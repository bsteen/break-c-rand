# Project 2: Break C's random number generator
I have a test script in class 8 which will run for some unknown amount of time then spit out 93 numbers in a row.
Your job is to predict the next 93 exactly. You can pull this off with less numbers and more brute forcing but this is an assignment centered around how to find a foothold in the math of prngs.
All of symmetric key crypto is driven by PRNGs.
